Navigating the complexities of hotel booking losses, this project delved into a thorough analysis. I explored the nuances impacting cancellations and revenue, proposing data-driven enhancements to pricing and promotional strategies. The outcomes were quite encouraging: a commendable **10% boost** in **revenue** and an appreciable **12% reduction** in **reservation cancellations**. This endeavor underscores my proficiency in:
